what is program ?


We use computer to perform computational task

Program is set of instruction on data

Data + Instruction (Program)



Human understand Natural Language (English)

Computer Under Understand Machine Language (0, 1)

Human --> Programming Language (c++, java, python) --> compiler/interpretor -> machine Language



Low level VS High level language 
--------------------------------

    Low Level
        Machine Language (binary language)
        Assembly Language


    High Level (in between english like and machine language)

    c++
    java
    python
    .... etc
    c
    c#
    Vb
    vc++



Compiler - Interpeter - Hybrid
-------------------------------

    1. check errors
    2. convert into machine code
    3. execution of the program (hdd --> ram (main memory) --> cpu)

    - Compiler doesn't takes the responsibility of execution
    - Interpeter takes the responsibility of execution

    compiler (c, c++)
    ------
    cpp source code --> compiler --> machine code --> exceutable file (.exe) 
    - Compiler generates the machine code (translation, only once required)
    - No need of compiler to run the program
    - compile program run independantly 

    interpeter (javascript, python)
    -----------
    - chrome work as interpeter for java script
    - line by line translate(compile) convert to machine code, 
        and execute it (executed bychrome)
    - every time it translate before execution
    - till particular error it will execute good
    - interpeted program run inside interpeter (in context)

    hybrid
    -----------
    java, c#
    compiler --> (check for errors) bytes code ---> JVM (machine code, interpeter) --> execution



Operating System
--------------------
    Windows, Linux, Mac OSX

    Its a master program that utilize the resources of computer system and 
    provide services to user.
    resources : cpu, main memory, monitor, hdd, network, printer, mosue, keyboard
   
    user --> program --> (system call)  os --> resources of computer
